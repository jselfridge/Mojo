      Number used as Dual Port RAM:              0
      Number used as Single Port RAM:            0
      Number used as Shift Register:             5
        Number using O6 output only:             3
        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                  2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        60 out of   2,860    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          321
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           145 out of     321   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  64 out of     321   19%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         112 out of     321   34%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
